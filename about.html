	<p>Options! Finally I've added some sort of options screen, needs a bit of work but I'm really happy with it</p>
	<p>Gonna have to work on the themes more in the future, but for now I think I'm gonna focus on gameplay again</p>

	<p>I've still been working on this game, though I just haven't updated the about page.</p>
	<p>Starting to implement a saving system, which is long overdue, but the only way I can think of making it work is far too inefficient, I hope I can figure out how to make it compact...</p>
	<p>Also, it's v0.3 now... maybe the real incremental is the version number</p>

	<h2>10/10/2021:</h2>
	<p>HUGE changes, I'm honestly surprised with how much progress I've made on the game recently</p>
	<p>I'm beginning to add tier 3 buildings which gives UwUs, I'll either have to make the upgrade give more or figure out offline gain, because it's very slow...</p>
	<p>got new side bar things, hooray for me</p>

	<p>Unfortunately I haven't worked on the game too much, but I have been-</p>
	<p>hold on my cat is scratching at my door</p>
	<p>she is inside now</p>
	<img id="screenshot" src="Resources/hi_tiger.jpg"></img>
	<p>she is all powerful, and I think she is fully aware of this...</p>
	<p>anyway so I've just been balancing things, I'm working on fully automating the game and while it's possible at this point, it's unrealistic, so more balancing it is!!</p>
	<h2>3/10/2021:</h2>
	<p>Version 0.2 I guess, I don't think I'll ever realease this but if I do, hi people, tell me why you're here</p>

    <h2>2/10/2021:</h2>
    <p>This is a very early version of the game, the only purpose of this game is for me to get used to HTML, CSS and JS.</p>
    <p>...yes, that does mean basically everything here is copied and pasted but hey, it functions</p>
    <p>This is what the game currently looks like:</p>
